 Hey, Cleveland. Happy, happy Labor Day.  When we were trying to figure out where we could be, we all said, "Let's go to Cleveland."  And I want to thank Congresswoman Marcia Fudge for hosting us. 

 I haven't talked so every time I think about Trump I get allergic.  Boy, we have 63 days to go.

 Well, thank you. Well -- well, you just heard the next vice president, didn't you?  In addition to thanking Marcia Fudge, let me also thank your great senator Sherrod Brown. Also -- excuse me. Also, two other great members of Congress, Tim Ryan and Joyce Beatty.  And your mayor, thanks to Mayor Jackson.  And I hope -- I hope that Ohio will send Ted Strickland to the Senate.  Now behind me are some of the great labor leaders of our country -- Randi Weingarten...  ... Lee Saunders...  ... Rich Trumka.  I'm proud to be on the same stage with them because they're always fighting for working families. Now, once I get over my allergic reaction...  ... let me say that, we are here in part because we know how important this election is to Ohio. It's not just, as Tim said -- that Ohio is one of the battleground states you hear about every four years. It's that Ohio represents everything that's great about America, and all of the challenges and the opportunities that we face. That's why this election is critical to every person in this state. And what I want to emphasize is I know we can't face our problems alone. We have to work together. We believe we are stronger together. And that is in stark contrast to Donald Trump. Remember what he said at his convention. He said, I, alone, can fix it. Now, think about what that leaves out, my friends. That leaves out all of our troops on the front lines. It leaves out our police officers and firefighters who run toward danger. It leaves out doctors and nurses who care for us. It leaves out teachers and educators who care for the most important people in our lives, our children. It leaves out everybody except him. And when he says, I, alone, can fix it, that clearly demonstrates he doesn't understand how America works, how we got great, and why we are great today, and what we need to do together to face the future. Because our campaign is about we will fix it together, we will work together, we will bring our country together.  And what better example of that are our labor unions. They are built...  ... on the principle of solidarity. They look out for each other. They fight for fair wages and collective bargaining for safe working conditions. Just last week, we learned once again because another study came out that confirms what we already knew. When more workers are in unions, wages are higher and not just for union members, but for all workers.  That's why if Tim and I are elected, we're going to say no to attacks on unions. No to rolling back collective bargaining. No to unfair trade deals like TPP. No to pension cuts that deny you the secure retirement that you've earned. No to right to work because right to work is wrong for workers and wrong for America.  But we're not just about saying no. We're going to say yes to standing up for workers rights and dignity. Yes to good jobs and benefits. Yes to the American dream. It is big enough for everyone to share the promise.  And so, that's why during this campaign, I have been running a campaign based on issues, not insults.  I believe anyone who asks for your vote should tell you what they're going to do. Starting tomorrow, you can read about the plans Tim and I have because we're putting out a book. Did somebody have a copy of that book? Hey, somebody back there, you got a copy of the book I can show the crowd? We're putting out a book called "Stronger Together."  That's more than a slogan for the campaign. That's a guiding principle for the future we want to build, and that's exactly what we're going to do. Now some people say, wait a minute, you've got so many plans. Well, you're right, I do have plans. You know, why? Because I want you to know what I want to do to help you and what kind of results we're going to work to achieve. I have this old-fashioned idea that if you're asking somebody to vote for you, they ought to tell you what they want to do and then hold you accountable when you get elected.  And I'll tell you what, our plans start with a very simple idea, that we're going to get the economy to work for everyone, not just those at top. We're going to do it with the biggest investment in new jobs that we've had since World War II. More infrastructure jobs, advanced manufacturing jobs, clean renewable energy jobs. Anyone willing to work hard should have a job that can support them and their families, a job with dignity with only a future to be proud of, not to worry about. We're also going to offer new solutions for families. Families are different today than they were in the 1950s for heaven's sakes, so we need to make sure we help support families the way they are today, not way back when, helping people support and balance family and work with paid family leave, earned sick days, affordable childcare.  And finally guaranteeing equal pay for women's work.  And here is our book. It's called "Strong Together" for a reason. You can read about what we want to do on the economy and everything else. It will be available starting tomorrow, because the choice for families has never been clearer. Just look at Donald Trump's track record when it comes to hardworking men and women. I know, I'm allergic to it, too, but we have to look at his record. There are many people you know who are thinking about voting for him. And you know, friends don't let friends vote for Trump.  And here is what you can tell among many things, he hired a union-busting firm to break up and organizing campaign at his hotel in Las Vegas. He built his career on refusing to pay workers, plumbers, painters, glass installers, marble installers, people who did work for him, and then he refused to pay them. He stiffs small businesses like my dad. My dad and Tim's dad had really small businesses that gave us a good middle-class life. I am just so grateful my father never got a contract from Donald Trump.  My dad worked hard. He printed drapery fabrics. And I would go help him sometimes. There'd be a long table in his print plant. And the fabric would be rolled out, and then the silk screens would be laid down, and then you pour the paint in, then you take the squeegee. You push it across the screen. You lift it up. You go all the way down and you go to the second table all the way back. Then when he finished, he'd load those drapery fabrics into his car and deliver them. I don't know what would have happened to my family if he had done a big job thinking it was a good deal for Trump and he gets there, and the Trump people say, we're not going to pay you. And then after harassing, maybe they say, OK, we'll pay you 30 cents on the dollar. He has driven hard-working people into bankruptcy and taken six bankruptcies himself. Now here in Ohio, you know very much that a president makes decisions that affect people's lives and livelihoods. When millions of jobs were on the line in the auto industry, President Obama made the right decision to save the auto industry.  I know we've got some UAW members here.  I was proud to support them then. I'm even prouder now that the auto industry just had its best year ever.  Think how differently things could have turned out. I know this is hard to imagine if it had been Donald Trump in the Oval Office. Last year -- remember this, last year, he said it didn't matter whether or not we save the auto industry. Either way would have been acceptable. He said we could have just let it go. Never mind the 850,000 people in Ohio and millions more across the country whose jobs and paychecks were tied to the auto industry. Now what else could we expect from someone whose most famous words are, you're fired? This is the kind of difference that this election really poses. People like Tim and me, who want to create more good jobs with rising wages and benefits for everybody willing to work hard, that's the basic bargain of America. And somebody who stiffed people to bankruptcy and laid off people, one of his bankruptcies put 1,000 people out of work. Every time you hear him talk about how he knows how to create jobs, just look at the facts. Educate yourself, and your friends, and your colleagues because, the kind of bluster and wild claims that he makes about everybody and everything don't stand up to any scrutiny. The same is true when it comes to whether we keep our country safe. Stronger together means working with our allies and our partners, right?  We're not just electing a president, we're electing a commander-in-chief. So when Donald Trump says, and I quote, "I know more about ISIS than the generals do." When he claims, as he has, that our Armed Forces are a disaster or he insults a Gold Star family, that's not just wrong and offensive, that's dangerous. Our military is a national treasure. And a president must respect the men and women who risk their lives and wear the uniform of our country.  Some of you know Tim Kaine's son is deployed right now. He's a Marine.  Tim and I will not only respect our men and women in uniform, we will protect them, and we will ensure that they are given the resources that they need to do the dangerous missions we ask them to do on our behalf. Last week, we saw even more evidence that Trump is temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be president. In just a few hours, he managed to turn his trip to Mexico into an embarrassing international incident. He even got into a Twitter war with the president of Mexico. And then he delivered his most hate-filled, hard, hard line speech yet -- doubling down on his absurd plans to send a deportation force to roundup 16 million people to deport them. Now, you can't make this stuff up, can you? He can try to distract with divisive dangerous rhetoric. He could try to fool voters into thinking somehow he's not as harsh and inhumane as he seems, but it's too late. When you see what he has said and done in this campaign, when you see that he can't even go to a foreign country without getting into a public feud with the president, I think the answer is clear. Donald Trump does not have the temperament to be our commander-in-chief.  Imagine him in a real crisis. I've said it before, and I believe it -- a man you can bait with a tweet cannot be trusted with nuclear weapons.  Now, look, I know that these elections are always tight and hard. I am not taking anybody anywhere for granted. That's why we're here today because we need your help. We need to make sure we have an election that validates the kind of positive future that will make life better for the people of Ohio. And empty promises and raises to tax will do that. It won't get your family a job. It won't keep our troops safe. It won't heal the divides in America. I've spent my life fighting for kids and families. During the fight for health reforms, some of you remember, powerful interest blocked our way, but I didn't give up. I turned around. I worked with Republicans and Democrats to help pass the Children's Health Insurance Program that covers 8 million kids today.  That's how you deliver real results. You can't get discouraged. You can't give up. You can never quit. But you got to start from the right values and principles. You've got to believe in our country. You've got to believe in the American people.  I'm asking for your help in these next two months. I'm asking you to reach out to your friends, your neighbors, your family -- everybody you can possibly touch. I'm asking you to join this campaign. You can go to hillaryclinton.com or you could text "Join," J-O-I-N, to 47246 because we want to win Ohio.  But you know, we don't want to just win it for the sake of winning it, we want to win it so that we can go onto the White House next January and get to work for you.  We want to win it so we can take all the plans and all the ideas that will improve your lives, that will get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top, which will help make education affordable so college is within reach of everyone, and help you pay back your student debt. We want to defeat ISIS, keep our alliances strong. We want to break down the barriers that hold any American back. That's why we're running. We're not running because it's a nice thing to do after you have a reality TV show, right? We're running because between Tim and I, we have a lot of years -- a lot of years of public service. And we believe in what we can do together, and we believe that we can make our country even greater. So please join the campaign. Be part of us having an American future that is better than the past, that creates the opportunities for every single man, woman, and child. Thank you, and God bless you.

 Hello.  Wow. Thank you all.  Thank you. Thank you so much. And it's wonderful to be back. I had such a good time last year. I said put that back on my calendar for Labor Day; I want to be on the banks of the Mississippi with friends from Illinois and Iowa talking about how we're going to make this economy work for everybody, not just those at the top. And it gives me such a great sense of real privilege and honor to be up on this stage with the people you see before you. Starting with my friend and former colleague, the great senator from Illinois, Dick Durbin, who has been in so many ways the conscience of the United States Senate. You heard him say he comes from a union family. He knows what hard work is. He stands up every day in that Senate. I hope you get a chance to watch him on C-SPAN sometime. Because he carries such passion and conviction in his voice about everything that he's fighting for. So thank to our friends from Illinois for sending Dick Durbin to the Senate for all the years and for however long he wants to be there. And please, be sure he is joined by Tammy Duckworth as your next senator.  Dick -- Dick reminded me that I endorsed Tammy here last year. I was looking for the fight occasion to do that. And I figured right here in her state would be the perfect opportunity. I just can't tell you how much I admire this brave woman. And she's going to bring so much to the Senate, to our national debate about issues that are critical to America's future. So please do everything you can to make sure that Tammy is in the Senate.  And let me also recognize and thank your congresswoman. Cheri Bustos, thank you.  Cheri has already made a great impression in the Congress. And she is working hard every day. She's another keeper. She's somebody who will only do more and more as she is there longer and has the chance to really make things happen for her constituents. I also want to recognize my friend, Congressman Dave Loebsack, from across the river, who was here earlier.  I don't think I need to remind everybody from Iowa, but please turn out and vote not only for Dave, but vote for Democrats. Vote for Patty Judge for Senate. Vote for other Democrats for Congress.  And it's a thrill to be here with three great union leaders, people who I admire and really appreciate the chance to work with, and look forward to working with as president: the UAW president, international, Dennis Williams; IBEW, international President Lonnie Stephenson; and of course, president of the NEA for the educators, Lily Eskelsen.  Now, each of these leaders are pretty special people, and I think you know Doug was pretty happy that they're here. He told me, "We've got three international presidents here." And I said knowing these three, they're happy to be here. This is not some kind of Labor Day obligation. They are with their members. They're working on behalf not only of those in the union, but we know, it was just proven again last week, that unions not only raise incomes and provide benefits for union members, but because of unions, everybody is better off. And that's a message I'm going to talk about every single day in this campaign.  Now, this is such a beautiful day, and you all came out here to celebrate Labor Day with all of us. And I am thrilled that I have a chance to just say a few words. I really believe we are stronger together. That was the theme of our convention. And coming out tomorrow, Tim Kaine and I have a book called "Stronger Together." And I'll tell you why we did this book. I think if you run for president, you ought to tell people what you want to do. Right?  And what I've tried to do in this book, and it's so great having Senator Kaine by my side now, is to lay out a blueprint for America's future. How are we going to get more good jobs? Infrastructure jobs, advanced manufacturing jobs, clean renewable energy jobs, how are we going to make sure that the economy not only is growing and producing more jobs with rising incomes but is being fair? So that people are treated fairly. That's why we support, we support raising the national minimum wage so that you're not living in poverty when you work full time.  My opponent thinks wages are too high. I don't know who he talks to, but he actually says that and he doesn't believe in raising the national minimum wage. I also believe in doing more to support small businesses. My dad was a small businessman, I believe that we need to do everything we can to help small businesses succeed. Tim Kaine and I were together in Cleveland earlier, we talked about that. Tim's dad ran a union shop, iron workers. And he's proud of that. That he had a small business father who ran a union shop and employed union workers providing good products. I also believe that we have to go finally guarantee equal pay for women's work.  And that's because I believe in fairness. I don't want to see anybody treated unfairly and discriminated against. I don't care who you are, if you're willing to work and do your part, you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead. That is the basic bargain of America. So if you look at this book, which I hope you will, it stands in stark contrast to Donald Trump. He says, I alone can fix it. Now, the folks I have met during this campaign and for many years before, know that we have challenges, know we've got to come together and believe we have to work together to fix what our problems are, that's my view. I want us to bring people together just the way unions do, just the way people in communities do. And here in the quad cities and across the country, we can see proof every day that we have to come together to meet our challenges. So I'm going to continue to emphasize that we want to be the uniters in this campaign. We believe that America is already great and that we can become greater if we do our part.  When somebody says, I alone can fix it, think of the people he's leaving out, everybody else. Leaving out our troops on the front lines, leaving out firefighters and police officers who run toward danger, leaving our teachers and educators who do they best to change children's lives. Leaving out everybody else. That is his campaign in a nutshell and what we've got to do in the next 63 days is to present the vision of America we believe in. So we're going to continue to say, we're stronger together, we're going to work together, we're going to run a campaign of issues, not insults. And we are going to be absolutely strong in our support for unions, because we know...  Nobody gets through life alone. Unions help build the largest middle-class in the history of the world in our country. They fought for fair wages, safe working conditions. They've helped so many people get on that run to the middle-class. And their kids, like Dick Durbin, go even higher. So I am going to say no to a tax on unions. I am going to say no to rolling back collective bargaining. I am going to say no to unfair trade deals, like the TPP. I'm going to say no...  No to pension cuts that deny you the secure retirement that you have worked for, and I'm going to say no to right to work. It's not right for workers, and it is not right for America.  But I will say yes to the American dream and here's what I believe. The American dream is big enough for all of us. If we build it, we will expand it and create more opportunities. And as we run this campaign on issues, our most important -- our most important goal is getting the economy to work for everybody. There's nothing -- nothing more important. And how do you do that? By creating more jobs and what are some of the areas that I think we can really emphasize? Infrastructure. Our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our airports.  Also, what we can't see, our water systems, our sewer systems. We also need a new electric grid, a modern electric grid to be able to take and distribute clean, renewable energy. I have a goal for us to install a half a billion more solar panels by the end of my first term.  It takes a lot of -- a lot of jobs, a lot of people working to do that. And then enough clean energy to power every home by the end of my second term.  I also want to finish the work of broadband interconnectivity, we have places in our country that still have dial-up. We have places where kids can't do the homework assignments their teachers give them because they don't have access to the internet. That is so unfair. Think of all the jobs we'll create when we finish that off. And then let's look at advanced manufacturing. I believe we can compete with anybody if we put our minds to it, and I'm going to have a manufacturing renaissance policy that will put people to work.  I -- I am so proud that Dennis and Lonnie are here because they've been doing so much to really create the new industries and autos and what the IBEW does in so many important areas of our economy. I want to be your partner. And I think it's especially important to recognize that when the chips were down and the auto industry was on its back, President Obama did the right thing. He saved the American auto industry.  I supported him then and I support him just as strongly now. The American auto industry just had the best year it's had in a long time and that was because of the teamwork and the partnership that we had between the companies. Between the union and because the president of the United States knew we had to save the auto industry. Donald Trump basically said, he didn't care, didn't matter to him. It just shows you how he doesn't understand or care about the real jobs that put bread on the table and give people a sense of purpose and dignity. Well you won't have to look far to find me in the Oval Office, if I'm fortunate enough to be your president, and to do everything I can, every single day to create more jobs, to save jobs, to bring jobs back from overseas.  And if you contrast that with Trump, his track record -- his track record is just the opposite. He actually hired a union busting firm for one of his hotels in Las Vegas. He built a career out of not paying workers for the work they did. We're talking painters, plumbers, electricians, people who thought it was a big deal working for Donald Trump, one of his resorts, his casinos. He stiffed them. He stiffs small businesses. Like I said, my dad was a small businessman, he printed drapery fabrics. He'd get an order, he'd buy the material, he'd get the silk screens made. I would go sometimes to help him in his print plant. He'd have these long tables, the fabric would be laid out. You would take the silk screen, you'd put it down, you'd pour the paint in, you'd take the squeegee, you'd push it across, you'd lift the screen up, you go all the way down, get on the next table, all the way back. Took a lot of time. Took a lot of hard work. When he finished, he'd load up the fabrics in his car and he'd go deliver them. I am so happy he never got a contract from Donald Trump.  I don't know what my family would've done if my dad did business with people like Trump, who has told hundreds and hundreds of small business, he's been sued 4,000 times for not paying the bills that he owes. If my dad had been told, sorry just kidding, we're not paying you -- this is the man who wants to be President of the United States? This is someone who doesn't even honor contracts? That's what is so dangerous about this election. What Donald Trump says, what he says about the economy, that he knows how to create jobs. He had six bankruptcies. In one bankruptcy alone, 1,000 people lost their jobs. The numbers add up. He talks about wanting to protect jobs in America but everything he makes, he's made overseas. He could have made suits and ties and furniture in the United States but no, he made it overseas. He even hires workers from overseas. And he tells people well, he couldn't find Americans who wanted to work in the heat. You can't make this stuff up, can you? It is truly unbelievable. But what's even worse is what he says about foreign policy. As bad as he is about our economy, he has insulted our allies, he has made common cause with dictators, he has basically endorsed Vladimir Putin and his policies. When he says, "I know more about ISIS than the generals"; when he claims our armed forces are a disaster, or he insults a Gold Star family, that's not just offensive. That's dangerous. And just today, our intelligence professionals said there was credible evidence for them to pursue an investigation into Russia's efforts to interfere with our election, hacking the Democratic National Committee. And when Putin was asked about it, didn't deny it. In fact, he said it was probably a good thing it happened. And this is the person that Donald Trump praises. We saw even more evidence last week that he is temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be president. In just a few hours, he managed to turn his trip to Mexico into an embarrassing international incident. I mean, just look at what happened. He got into a Twitter war with . And why? Because the president of Mexico said, "I told him in the meeting we weren't paying for that wall."  So, not only did Trump mess up his first international engagement, he choked. He couldn't even bring himself to tell the president of Mexico one of his very few policy demands. I mean, he went back to Arizona and gave another hate-filled speech about rounding up and deporting 16 million people. Even some of his own advisers are having a hard time explaining that away. So he's going to try to distract and divide. He's going to hope that we don't pay attention to what he's been saying for 14, 15 months. And we just tune in now, these last two months, that he's somehow softening his positions; that there's a really another Donald Trump out there. Well, you've got to ask yourself, if you can't even go to a friendly foreign country without getting into a fight, can this person even claim to have the temperament to be in the Oval Office and deal with real urgent crises? As I've said before, and I'll say it again, a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not be anywhere nuclear weapons.  But we have a lot of work to do. I think every election is close and tight and tough. That's why we have to work as hard as we can between now and when the last votes are counted. And that's why I need your help. I want to get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top. I want to be sure that we lead the world with strength and steadiness, and that we protect America here at home and around the world. And I want to unify our country. I believe with all my heart...  ... that every American must vote, must vote. I see a woman holding a sign, "you must vote." Please, it will make a difference. And then she says "I'm a Gold Star daughter."  God bless you. God bless you. I spent my life fighting for kids and families. I don't give up. I don't quit. When we didn't get health care reform, I went to work with Republicans and Democrats. We passed the Children's Health Insurance Program that insures 8 million kids every year.  As Dick said, after we were attacked on 9/11, I worked with Democrats and Republicans to make sure we could rebuild New York and the Pentagon, and make sure we were as safe as we possibly could be. This election will determine so much about our future. And one thing I know for sure is we have to start listening to and respecting each other again. We may have differences. That's the American way. But we are stronger together. We can do anything if we put our minds to it. I saw the picture of Mother Theresa that was being held up here. And I was fortunate to know Mother Theresa. I was fortunate enough to actually work with her. We didn't agree on everything, but we found common ground. She asked me when I was first lady to get a home for babies started in Washington, so mothers who couldn't care for their babies could take their babies to a safe place and those babies could be adopted.  And when Mother Theresa asked you to do something, the only answer was "Yes, ma'am."  And I started working. And she would call me. She'd call me from India. She'd call me from Vietnam. She called me from everywhere. She'd say, "Where's my home?"  And I'd say, "Well, Mother, working with the Washington, D.C. Zoning Department requires divine intervention."  And so she did, and we got it done.  Here's what I hope you will do. I hope you will get involved in this campaign for these last two months. I hope you will go to HillaryClinton.com and see how you can work in Illinois, in Iowa. I hope you will text JOIN -- J-O-I-N, and go to 47246, to see what you can do. We need everybody involved. There has never been a more important consequential election in our lifetimes.  And we need to elect progressive leaders like Tammy and Cheri and Dave Loebsack and others who are on the ballot as well. I am confident and optimistic about America's future. When I listened to Donald Trump, when I watched his convention, I honestly did not know what country he was talking about. It was so dark, so dire, so depressing. That's not the America I know. It's not the America that I see. I don't deny that we have problems. Of course, we do. We're human beings. But my goodness, would you live anywhere else?  Would you give up our freedom, our values, our opportunity for anywhere else? I traveled to 112 countries as your secretary of state. And everywhere I went, I was so proud to land that plane which said "The United States of America" on it, and to come down those stairs and begin to meet on behalf of our values, our interests and our security. And there is not a place, despite what they say, that doesn't envy who we are and what we have. We cannot put any of that at risk my friends.  So for these last two months, join this campaign, help us make history, make sure that we are continuing to be not just great, but even greater. And that we're creating opportunities for the next generation, like my grandchildren. That's what we can do together if we remember we are stronger together. God bless you.
